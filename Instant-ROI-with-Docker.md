## Instant ROI with Docker

I'm a late adopter. Very seldom that I throw away a trusty solution to invest months and months until I get the long awaited benefits of the cutting edge - if ever.

It's boring to be Laszlo: only recently that I got excited about having a Macbook, and I missed Slack as something important.

**I recall two distinct occasions though that I got excited by technology**. Late 2008 by Android, and spring of 2013 by [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/), a machine learning framework. 
While they are two rather distant fields in computing, they had something in common: they both were very approachable and had disproportionate upsides... and I have the exact same experience with Docker today.

## Two days investment 
When I say approachable, I mean that. Any developer without prior knowledge to Docker - albeit with some affinity to build systems - can *dockerize* most projects with moderate complexity in two days. 

From that moment on the whole team benefits from a completely sharable local development environment. Just like with Vagrant and VMs, but this time for real.


## One common developer workflow

While there are a series of upsides using Docker (the first three articles of me googling *Docker upsides* 
[1](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/7.0_Release_Notes/sect-Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux-7.0_Release_Notes-Linux_Containers_with_Docker_Format-Advantages_of_Using_Docker.html) [2](https://www.airpair.com/docker/posts/8-proven-real-world-ways-to-use-docker) 
[3](https://cloudhero.io/top-three-benefits-using-docker/)) I focus on one immediate benefit: having a common, lightweight, local development workflow in the team. All components are readily available to everyone and **three minutes after checkout anyone can start churning out features**, be that someone old or new. 

That fact alone fuels adoption and drives further iterations.

## And what about state?

..and how do you run it in production? And what about the thirty other things people ask.
 
There is an adequate answer for every question, but don't go down the rabbit hole. **Docker gives you value with a small investment today, start harvesting it**. 

There is plenty of time to discuss the best of breed in orchestration technology, which cloud provider to chose or discussing organizational barriers and whatnot. 

Instead, **have developers get comfortable with Docker and let them drive the change**. It's not an ops concern, but a new way of packaging applications that is becoming part of developers daily job. Just like it happened with Git and version control.
