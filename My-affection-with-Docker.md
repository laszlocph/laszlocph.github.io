## My affection with Docker

The ones who know me know how much I rant about company culture. How actions and company goals should reinforce each other. 

The borderline between tech and management excites me the most: how tech choices back up communication and vica-versa. If those are in line, you are golden, if not, no tactic or rallying talk save you.

## You probably noticed

Recently I was amazed how converged the Docker ecosystem is and - for the most of it - it really works. For the rest, innovation is lightning fast and by the time you get there, it will be there.

Most importantly **it yields practical benefits early on**. You can have a standardized local development environment within days. Anyone - old or new - can start churning out features minutes after checking out a project. Later, that environment can be reused for QA and production purposes. See my rant about [the instant ROI of Docker](https://laszlo.cloud/Instant-ROI-with-Docker).

## Get started

Many moved early, [Docker on Amazon ECS is a common route to take](https://segment.com/blog/rebuilding-our-infrastructure/).

For the others, now is a good time to get started. The [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/) is approachable and it's getting streamlined by the day.

For the ones who prefer a focused learning experience or their team to kickstart easily, I try a new concept: the **[Docker kickstart for Developers course](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/docker-kickstart-for-developers-tickets-28859428327)**.

I distilled a few real life usecases that can set you up for a good first experience. And as always, you get a drop of pragmatism and hints for next steps.

Looking forward to see many of you, and start applying these practices at your company.

Onwards!
