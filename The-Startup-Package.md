### Are you concerned about scaling your team without having mature practices?

Your team achieved remarkable things so far with only a handful of resources. But how it all will function if you add five more members, effectively doubling your team?

Especially as certain things are already bothering but you won't mention it, as the team already works inhuman hours. 

* You wonder what would happen if your lead engineer goes on vacation?
* You wonder that the mayhem on release day.. is that really normal? The team enjoys the vibe, but is that sustainable?
* Are the habits and engineering practices of the team scalable?    
* What degree of process is really necessary?
* How can you make sure that production doesn't drop after scaling, and new engineers hit the ground running?

You might not have big problems today, in fact you deliver software faster than most. The truth is, scaling demands a lot more from individuals and in most cases different things that they do today. Soon the hivemind what you have today will vanish, and it will require structured effort to keep everybody in the loop.

### I offer a workshop and hands-on work to mature your engineering, release and testing practices so you don't lose productivity during the scaling

Your team is clever. You wouldn't make this far if they weren't. They could figure out how to work most effectively in the new situation, but it would take 6-12 months. **I offer a workshop and hands-on work to ease this transition.**

I fundamentally believe that you can only reach higher levels of execution by reflecting on your situation and constantly seeking to address inefficiencies. This requires conscious effort, the only catch is that humans are wired differently.

Pointing out problems is emotionally taxing as it's always somebody's work you criticize. It takes high confidence and conviction to take on the burden to change things. It don't come easy to many.

Coming from outside - and seeing it all - allows me to speed up the process. **In my Startup Workshop I facilitate discussions on the cornerstones of engineering productivity: culture, habits, agile and CI/CD.** 
As a follow up I also do hands-on work where it deems the most necessary: setting up the CI workflow, introducing advanced monitoring or code review practices.

<pre>
// we tailor the order and length of each topic to your needs and fit it to one day

*** Habits of scalable technical organizations *** 1hr
- One goal: building an institutional memory
- Tools: markdown, text based charting tool, screencast, scripts
- Eliminate, Automate, Delegate, Procrastinate
- Absolute minimum: Readme.md
- Integrations: ifttt, zapier
- How do you communicate?

*** What is culture anyway? *** <1hr
- Definition of culture
- Tell me about your culture!
- Context is everything

*** Effective behaviors in a scaling company *** <1hr
- Over-communication is king: what is granted today may not be granted if you hire 3 more guys
- Always be reflecting
- The rule of twenty, don't take it personal

*** Let's talk about processes *** <1hr
- Is process the enemy?
- Process represents knowledge in the org. Explain it from many angles

*** Let's talk about Agile *** 1-2 hrs
- Scrum basics, Kanban basics
- Roles, Meetings
- The importance of the Retrospective
- Have cadence, always show up: key to provide safe environment, key to plant practices
- Follow the guys who have done it before
- Have you considered introducing a more formal Agile process?

*** Measure everything *** 1-2 hrs
- The role of logs, metrics
- Tools: datadog, newrelic, opbeat, logstash, graylog, sentry, mixpanel
- Customer service is a culture thing
- Simple code examples
- Alerts
- No broken window policy
- The postmortem

*** Continuous Integration *** 1-2hrs
- Definitions CI, CD
- The power of integrating frequently
- Developers just want to ship, and get feedback instantly
- Due to small incremental changes the scope is comprehensible => less risk
- You can pin it to one guy
- Linearizing the changeset: from one change to 3 changes
- How to not to break apis
- Get off the release train: don't couple changes
- Feature flags

*** Git essentials *** 1-2hrs
- Git basics
- Oneliners for common situations
- The home screen button command
- Excercises

*** Comparing branching models *** 1 hr
- Gitflow
- Github flow
- Show me your branching model

*** CI vision, the containerized future *** <1r
- The possibility to showcase every in development feature
- Every component should run in 15mins after cloning
- Managing dependencies with Docker

</pre>

It takes a flat price of X DKK and you spare weeks of wavering discussions of eg. what branching workflow to pick. 
Suddenly many alternatives will be on the table and openly discussed in the team on a level playing field. 

The workshop also provides an overview of what are the next steps to achieve a higher level of execution. I help jumping those hoops for a Y DKK daily fee.

If you are unsure about taking me on the offer, let me highlight a few things.
* I know your team can figure it out. That's why I won't impose my preferences on you. Instead, I guide the team through the process to find an adequate solution fast. By showing alternatives, and making decisions where you can't decide.

* You think it's expensive? Looking at the daily fee might give you that impression. The bottomline is though that you reach cruising speed with your doubled team within a month, compared to the 6-12 months it usually takes. For roughly a month salary of one of your senior engineer.

* Afraid of building expertise outside of the company? Let me tell you about my new obsession I picked up in 2015. I document everything. Where I go, markdown files, automation scripts and screencasts follow. I'm obsessed with tools like [Mermaid](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#sequence-diagrams) and not just using them but advocating them heavily. 
I firmly believe that the most important asset a company has is its *institutional memory*.

* You learned that consultants are all fancy talk, but no action? They certainly have that reputation, but I'm wired differently. I'm rather impatient and have an inner urge to deliver something tangible every single day. Without my fix I'm rather grumpy, what I seek to avoid as much as I can.

How do I work?

**Baby Steps**<br/>
I work in short iterations. Consider the workshop as trying the cooperation on for size. See if it fits.

**Transparency Clause**<br/>
The workshop outline is discussed beforehand and tailored for any specific topic you want to focus on. We sit down after the workshop and discuss the further steps. If there are any - see Baby Steps

**Chemistry Clause**<br/>
In your situation every opportunity when the team gets to step back - and have a chance to reflect - has a huge upside. If chemistry doesn't work between me and the team, you still benefit of having the team coming together in a safe environment and discuss the things that need to come up in the following months.

As a closing thought let me tell you about my past. 

My service is delivery focused and it carries the perspective I gained spending five years at Falcon.io. I was an early employee, starting as an individual contributor being responsible for everything backend. Later, I became Director of Engineering and scaled engineering to 7 teams of 7. Each team going for the original vision.

I'm looking forward to apply this experience at your company and reach new heights together.

Yours sincerely - Laszlo
