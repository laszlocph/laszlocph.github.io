## Becuse shift happens
 
Docker is taking over the Cloud. [DataDog's numbers](https://www.datadoghq.com/docker-adoption/){:target="_blank"} show that 10% of their monitored hosts are now running Docker. 

Each hosts running five containers on average, proving that the promise is real, **Docker** doesn't just standardize how developers package their software, but also drives cost down.

Docker also promotes modern **Devops** practices that are increasingly important for companies. Taking a lean approach on product development [predicts higher IT performance](https://puppet.com/resources/white-paper/2016-state-of-devops-report){:target="_blank"}.

Technology is no longer just a supporting capability. Shorter cycles enable business R&D activities that result in significant market advantages.

## Faster onboarding, smaller Cloud bill

Imagine that a new developer joins your team and in ten minutes she is able to run the whole stack locally and ready to churn out features. 

Imagine that the very same day she is able to deploy her changes to your audience through an all automated delivery pipeline. 

Docker gives you all that plus **streamlined operations** within your organization and a **smaller cloud bill**.

## Good to meet you

I'm a former early employee and Director of Engineering of [Falcon.io](https://falcon.io){:target="_blank"}. I started as an individual contributor being responsible for everything backend, later I became Director of Engineering and scaled engineering to 7 teams of 7.

The fall of 2016 I started #laszlo.cloud, a consultancy to focus on my sweetspot: **driving the devops transition** with technology and communication backing up each other. 

Understanding both tech and people gives me the right perspective to do so. Because leading engineers is no herding cats.

## What am I up to these days?
* 24th Nov - Presented in Malmo on the Javaform [Docker for everyone](https://www.meetup.com/Javaforum-Malmo/events/234911104/){:target="_blank"} on Javaforum. It went well, although this time the material was a bit too much and I rushed through many of the concepts. Still I think people got a great deal of things to check further on the internet. Good crowd.

* I'm helping the [24Slides](https://24slides.com/) team on an ongoing part-time basis. The team carries the right amount of ambition and skill, also they have two of my ex-colleagues that is a great sign for me.

* 16th Nov - I gave a talk in Malmo. I was very happy about the long QA that followed.

* 15th Nov - I attended the [Rancher](http://rancher.com){:target="_blank"} partnership event in Geneva. Met some members of the team and learned nice tricks on their training.

* 9th Nov - I headed to Amsterdam to assist Adrian Mouat at his [Docker Tutorial](http://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/devops-web-performance-eu/public/schedule/detail/54134){:target="_blank"} delivered at VelocityConf@Amsterdam.

* I've prepared a short workshop for a local growing company. After the workshop hands-on work follow to strengthen the core practices that will help them long term.
