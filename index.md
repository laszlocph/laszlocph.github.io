Hi, I'm Laszlo Fogas, Devops Consultant. 

**I help software teams to move their Docker experiments to production.**

## Do you know how to navigate the container landscape?
* Kubernetes or Docker Swarm, maybe Mesos?
* How to handle persistence? Secrets?
* What CI server to use?
* Is Docker ready for production? Is it secure?
* Can I use my existing ELK stack? Grafana?
* What about the database?

It's so simple using Docker locally with Compose, but how do you move all that to production? 

It's almost a full time job navigating the container landscape with all that is happening, the different vendors and technologies. 

## I've dedicated my past year to answer all these questions.

Participated in three orchestration projects using Redhat's Openshift and the Rancher Kubernetes distribution. 

And I'm ready to help your project. 

I created the **Compose to Production** email course that walks you through the bits and pieces you have to account for when you move your Docker workloads to production. 

The title works with the premise that Docker Compose is in use in your organization.  If that's not the case, that should not discourage you. It really just a way to express the premise this course is working with: that basic Docker knowledge is ubiquitous, devs use it and love it for their development environments, but there is a giant wall and confusion when it comes to moving all that to production.

Cut through the noise and enroll now. The first lesson will arrive immediately in your inbox and you will receive the next eight in the following days. 

Completing the course you will have clarity and know what to do to complete your Docker project successfully.

## Good to meet you

I'm a former early employee and Director of Engineering of Falcon.io. I started as an individual contributor being responsible for everything backend, later I became Director of Engineering and scaled engineering to 7 teams of 7.

The fall of 2016 I started Laszlo Cloud, a consultancy to focus on my sweetspot: **driving the devops transition** with technology and project management backing up each other. 

Understanding both tech and people gives me the right perspective to do so. Because leading engineers is no herding cats.
