Hi, I'm Laszlo Fogas, freelance software consultant. 

**I help growing teams mature their engineering practices to become scalable technical organizations.**

I offer workshops and hands-on work to  level-up engineering, release and testing practices so you **donâ€™t lose productivity during scaling**.

## What am I up to these days?

9th Nov, I'm heading to Amsterdam to assist [Adrian Mouat](http://www.adrianmouat.com/) at his [Docker Tutorial](http://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/devops-web-performance-eu/public/schedule/detail/54134) delivered at VelocityConf@Amsterdam. 
This is an awesome opportunity - I can't wait.

I've launched an intro Docker course for developers as there are some immediate upsides that any team can benefit from. I wrote about this in detail in the <a href="http://laszlo.cloud/Instant-ROI-with-Docker">Instant ROI with Docker</a> article.
It is reasonably priced as it is a foundation skill for everyone on your team.

I've prepared a short workshop for a local growing company with the following high level agenda. We are planning on hands-on work once the workshop took place and strengthen the core practices that will help them long term.

* Habits of scalable technical organizations
* What is culture anyway?
* Effective behaviors in a scaling company
* Let's talk about processes
* Let's talk about Agile
* Measure everything
* Continuous Integration
* Git essentials
* Containers 101

## About me

I'm a former early employee and Director of Engineering of Falcon.io. I spent five years with the company and witnessed the growth from 3 to 200 employees. 

Started as an individual contributor being responsible for everything backend. 
Later, I became Director of Engineering and scaled engineering to 7 teams of 7.

After being employed for more than ten years, I'm venturing out to help companies leveling up their teams. 

Throughout my career I saw all too many times how teams suffer without firm leadership. Sometimes it's caused by lack of time, sometimes 
lack of seniority, but in all cases it's amazing to see how even a little strategic attention works magic
 on productivity. An engaged engineer is a productive engineer.
 
 
#### Let's talk if
 * your team needs a shakeup
 * your team is looking to expand significantly
 * if you are unsure that introducing process is the right next step
 * if you experience slowdown in your team's output
 * if your engineers *just don't get it*
 * or if you are interested what was it like to be part of FalconIO's growth from 3 to 200 employees.

#### My mistress <3

We live in a fantastic era. An era where software delivery is revolutionized beyond imagination.

One of the key components to FalconIO's fast iteration cycles was the simple **Continuous Integration (CI)** process where engineers 
could test and release changes on their own, not bundling different changes together - and as a result - not introducing additional 
coordination needs in the software release. 

The past three years this infrastructure was put to test more than 3000 times, each time 
generating an independent sandbox environment. While it was built on Amazon AMIs, it served 
its purpose brilliantly and only reached its limits recently when we started to introduce microservices at scale.

Now I'm excited to spend time with my other love - **containerized** applications - and see how containers will supercharge this already 
proven way of releasing software.

I'm always up for a chat when it comes to CI/CD pipelines, try me: **<a href="mailto:laszlo@laszlo.cloud">laszlo@laszlo.cloud</a>**
