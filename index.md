## What am i up to these days?

After being employed for more than ten years, i'm venturing out to help companies levelling up their teams. 

Throughout my carreer i saw all too many times how teams suffer without firm leadership. Oftentimes it's simply the result of lack of 
time, sometimes the lack of seniority, but in all cases it's amazing to see how even a little strategic attention works magic
 on productivity. An engaged engineer is a productive engineer.
 
 
#### Let's talk if
 * your team needs a shakeup
 * your team is looking to expand significantly
 * if you are unsure that introducing process is the right next step
 * if you experience slowdown in your team's output
 * if your engineers *just don't get it*
 * or if you are just interested what was it like to be part of FalconIO's growth from 3 to 200 employees.

We live in a fantastic era. An era where software delivery is revolutionized beyond imagination.

One of the key components to FalconIO's fast iteration cycles was the simple **Continuous Integration (CI)** process where engineers 
could test and release changes on their own, not bundling different changes together - and as a result - not introducing additional 
coordination needs in the software release. 

The past three years this infrastructure was put to test more than 3000 times, each time 
generating an independent sandbox environment. While it was built on Amazon AMIs, it served 
its purpose brilliantly. Only when microservices came about, it started to show its rigidness.

Now i'm excited to spend time with my other love, **Containerized** applications. I'm excited to see how containers will supercharge the 
release process what already worked amazingly in action.

I'm always up for a chat when it comes to CI/CD pipelines, try me: **<a href="mailto:laszlo@laszlo.cloud">laszlo@laszlo.cloud</a>**
