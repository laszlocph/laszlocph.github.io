* Kubernetes or Docker Swarm, maybe Mesos?
* How to handle persistence? Secrets?
* What CI server to use?
* Is Docker ready for production? Is it secure?
* Can you use your existing ELK stack? Grafana?
* What about the database?

If you are like the managers I talked to recently, then you probably realized that the path between running Docker locally and running it in production is really not trivial.

It's so simple using Docker locally with Docker Compose, but how do you move all that to production? The number of decisions you have to make quickly become overwhelming. 
There is no clear answer for your questions and the expertise is not always available in your team.

## Get clarity and clear direction

To fast track your Docker orchestration project I deliver the key milestones that provide momentum and clear direction for your team.

Your team may deploy Dockerized services days after project start. I both set up the cluster and ramp up your team to be able to do so.

Hi, I'm Laszlo Fogas, your Devops Consultant from Copenhagen.  

I help large software teams moving their Docker experiments to production.

## IT Operations, Test Managers, Developers

Rolling out a Docker based service platform is a multi layer activity. Projects fail for multitude of reasons and many of them are not technical.

My background gives me the perspective to effectively operate on many levels of your organization. 
I manage stakeholders, advocate for developers and coach peers where and when it has the most impact for successful project delivery.
In the past I worked best closely with Operations Managers, Tooling Team Leads, Test and Release Managers of departments larger than twenty.

## The five steps to fast track your Docker project

Hire me, and have the following list of deliveries in a matter of weeks on a fix price: 

<div style="background: #f9f9f9; border: solid 1px #d1d1d1; color: #666; line-height: 1em; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;padding: 2em 1em 1em 1em" >
<p><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #66ff66"></i> The first services containerized and deployed on the cluster</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #66ff66"></i> Shipping logs to your aggregated logging solution</p> 
<p><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #66ff66"></i> Shipping metrics to your metrics solution</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #66ff66"></i> Routing traffic to your cluster with TLS on *.yourdomain.com</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #66ff66"></i> Developers ramped up to be able to deploy to the cluster</p>
</div>
<br/>

I found that having a working cluster where developers can deploy to changes the conversation. 

First off it sends a clear message to your organization that Docker is happening. Developers and stakeholders can see the vision in action, they will be able to do zero downtime deployments, with the tooling that is no different than later in production.
And third, it reveals those pesky requirements that are specific to your organization. The sooner they surface, the better chance we have to tackle them and not lose momentum on the way.

## Want to pick my brain?

I created the Compose to Production email course that walks you through the bits and pieces you have to account for when you move your Docker workloads to production. 

The title works with the premise that Docker Compose is in use in your organization. If that's not the case, that should not discourage you. It really just a way to express the premise that basic Docker knowledge is ubiquitous, devs use it and love it for their development environments, but there is a huge gap when it comes to moving all that to production.

If you enroll now, the first lesson will arrive immediately in your inbox.

## So what happens once I'm done?

I understand that this is going to be the core of your infrastructure that's why I make sure that during the whole process I work as transparently as possible. Where I go, markdown files and Pull Requests follow. 

I understand that not being in control can have huge repercussions in your uptime. That's why

<p><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #66ff66"></i> I deliver the cluster as code in an agreed configuration management tool. Terraform and Ansible is preferred, I have experience in Chef too.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #66ff66"></i> I work closely with your Ops team</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #66ff66"></i> I follow your deployment into production and beyond</p>
</div>

See what some of my kind clients has to say about this:

*"I felt like I had a good overview of what was done along the way and that we would not be reliant on Laszlo after the contract ends. 
We basically had a notion of what direction we wanted to move with our platform and Laszlo facilitated that swimmingly. 
Along the way we got very good coaching about how to evangelize the new service platform and help with presenting it to the dev teams."* - **Oscar Elfving, Operations Team Lead at Visma e-conomic A/S**

## Good to meet you

I'm a former early employee and Director of Engineering of Falcon.io. I started as an individual contributor being responsible for everything backend, later I became Director of Engineering and scaled engineering to 7 teams of 7.

The fall of 2016 I started Laszlo Cloud, a consultancy to focus on my sweetspot: **driving the devops transition** with technology and project management backing up each other. 

Understanding both tech and people gives me the right perspective to do so. Because leading engineers is no herding cats.
