## Freelance DevOps consulting in Copenhagen

{{ page.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}

I've been consulting for the past four years. In this post I write down every thought I have about it.

Read it if you are contemplating consulting, need practical advice on how to start, or if you are interested how I experienced this period.

### Getting the first gig

Getting the first gig, or any gig, is what people are the most anxious about in freelance consulting.

I've spent ten years in employment before I made the change, and naturally this should have been my main concern starting out. Going from a fixed monthly income to something uncertain should surely freak out people - or their moms at least.

But this was not the case for me. Partly because I successfully deceipt my brain with the mantra, that worst case, I can always get a job, but for the most part, I started out with a financial cushion. I started out in Octber 2016, with a money enough that I should not need to start job hunting until April 2017.

So here was I with a relative peace of mind, started out with researching container technologies, writing blog posts about it.
, and searching for my first gig. This peace of mind lasted for little over a month, besides content marketing I tried with direct outreach on email, LinkedIn and Twitter.
